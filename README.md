# Linux Patch Wednesday
For Microsoft products we have a single day of increased attention - Microsoft Patch Tuesday, and for Linux there is no such day.  Everything is too fragmented there and patches are released literally every day. But whatâ€™s stopping us from independently generating a list of CVEs fixed during the month and highlighting critical issues? Let's try!

If Microsoft Patch Tuesday occurs every second Tuesday of the month, then Linux Patch Wednesday will occur every third Wednesday of the month!
